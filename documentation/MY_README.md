# Y2 Project: Disease

# Checkpoint1 

# Current features / properties

What features have you already implemented in your project?

    - The most important classes are implemented with their main methods. 
    - E.g. Character, Brain, SimulationWorld and Square classes..
    - Different character classes such as Spreader, Susceptible and Recovered are still missing.
    - The basic structure of this program is based on the robot world program

What can you do with it at this stage?

    - At this stage the program isn't interactive.
    - The program cannot be run yet. 

# Schedule

Time spent on the project:

    - So far I have spent a couple of hours on the project.
    - The program is proceeding according to the plan.




# Checkpoint2 

# Current features / properties

What features have you already implemented in your project?

    - All of the classes are implemented with their main methods.
    - Some methods are still missing and some of the implemented ones need modifications, 
        especially the moving methods and methods that will lead to the status/AI change.
    - The main characters: Spreader, Susceptible and Recovered have their own AI's.  
    - Some of the moving algorithms are implemented, such as the move_body method for Spreaders.
    - Probably there will be some modifications in the moving algorithms of the character types.
    - There's one test for checking the location of a created Spreader character. 

What can you do with it at this stage?

    - The simulation cannot be run yet.
    - However, the program can be started: The grid will be formed and predefined characters will be added to the world. 
    - The program isn't interactive yet. The user can't give their preferred parameters,  
        since the program doesn't reed the input stream yet. 

# Schedule

Time spent on the project:

    - The project is still in its early stages and there is a lot of work to be done.
    - The progress has been quite slow so far since I haven't had too much
        time to spend on the project.
    - In May, I plan to dedicate more time to advancing the project.
